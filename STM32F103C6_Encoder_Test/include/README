This directory is intended for project header files.

A header file with the `.h` extension contains C/C++ declarations to be shared between several project source files. You can use the `#include` directive to include header files in your source code.

For example, if you have a header file `myheader.h` in this directory, you can include it in your source files using:

```cpp
#include "myheader.h"
```
